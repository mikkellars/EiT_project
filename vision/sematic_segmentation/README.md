# Sematic Segmentation for Fence Detection

This folder explores the use of sematic segmentation methods for segmenting the fence in a image.

The dataset [Fence Segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/chen-du/De-fencing) and synthetic data created with [synth-ml](https://gitlab.com/sdurobotics/vision/synth-ml), is used to train the different models.

## U-Net

A U-Net model is trained on both the [Fence Segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/chen-du/De-fencing) and synthetic data.

### Results

## SegNet

A SegNet model is trained on both the [Fence Segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/chen-du/De-fencing) and synthetic data.
